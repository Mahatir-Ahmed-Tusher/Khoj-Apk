## Overview

Khoj is the first and most comprehensive AI-based fact-checking platform in Bengali, designed to combat misinformation in the digital age. In a world flooded with information, distinguishing truth from falsehood can be challenging, especially for Bengali-speaking communities. Khoj addresses this by providing reliable tools to verify facts, debunk myths, and promote digital literacy. The platform helps prevent social, political, and personal harm caused by fake news, rumors, and half-truths circulating on social media, WhatsApp, Telegram, and news apps.

The Khoj Mobile App, developed in Java by the Khoj team under the leadership of Founder Mahatir Ahmed Tusher, brings these powerful features to your fingertips on Android devices. It integrates advanced AI technologies to make fact-checking fast, accessible, and user-friendly.

## Features

Khoj is more than just a fact-checking website—it's an integrated platform leveraging cutting-edge technology. Key features include:

### AI Fact-Checking
Enter any claim (e.g., "Bangladesh's St. Martin's Island is under American control and a new state is being established there") into the app, and Khoj's AI will analyze sources, evaluate reliability, and generate a comprehensive fact-check report in seconds. It highlights credible sources, potential doubts, and provides evidence-based conclusions. This feature uses advanced AI pipelines (learn more [here](https://biggani.org/bangla-ai-fact-checker-khoj/)).

### AI Myth-Busting
Go beyond simple true/false verdicts. Khoj explains myths conversationally, like a friend. Click the "Myth-Busting" button, enter a superstition or scientific claim, and receive a detailed report with context, scientific evidence, and a narrative debunking. This fosters critical thinking and long-term digital immunity against misinformation.

### Manual Fact-Checking
The Khoj team regularly verifies trending rumors manually. Recent debunkings are displayed on the home screen, combining AI speed with human analytical depth for reliable truth verification.

### Reverse Media Search
Similar to Google Lens but enhanced, upload an image to trace its origins across the internet. Identify contexts of viral photos used in rumors via a simple drag-and-drop interface, with real-time search progress.

### Text Verification
Analyze any Bengali text for plagiarism, duplicates, or AI generation. It also assesses readability and traces original sources for authenticity.

### Khoj Chat: Your AI Assistant for Verification
- **General Mode**: Discuss topics or verify information casually.
- **Verification Mode**: Chat to fact-check claims, with responses including reliable source links.
- **Citizen Services**: Get instant info on government services like NID, birth registration, passports, and legal queries, saving hours of searching. Includes relevant links. Access at: [https://www.khoj-bd.com/khoj-chat](https://www.khoj-bd.com/khoj-chat).

### Liberation War Corner - Liberation War Engine
Combat distortions of Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War history. Get authentic, unbiased results from historical documents, unlike general Google searches. Future enhancements include Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for answers from rare books, research, and archives not easily found online.

## Future Plans
The Khoj team is committed to evolving the platform:
- Audio and Video Search: Extend reverse search to audio/video files.
- Community Features: Allow users to submit claims for verification.
- Mobile App Expansion: Full Android and iOS apps for broader accessibility.
